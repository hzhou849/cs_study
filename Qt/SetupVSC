You should give a chance for this extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools

With this, you can configure include paths for better IntelliSense results.

Configuring includePath

One way to configure e.g the QtCore module.

Ctrl + Shift + p to open command palette
Search for: C/Cpp: Edit Configurations
You should have a new tab called: c_cpp_properties.json
In configurations array you should edit the Linux section
Add your paths in the includePath setting e.g: /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/QtCore

IntelliSense engines

We recommend using the "Default" engine for the best IntelliSense experience. However, it is possible to explicitly choose the IntelliSense engine by editing your user or workspace settings. The setting you should modify is C_Cpp.intelliSenseEngine

Default - Visual Studio's IntelliSense engine, which is the default engine that provides semantic-aware IntelliSense features
Tag Parser - the "fuzzy" IntelliSense engine that provides quick but "fuzzy" results, is used to provide the fallback experience if the default engine is
