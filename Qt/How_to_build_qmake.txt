How to build Qt project. If you do not want to use CMAKE and want to use qmake for easy build:

required packages:
sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake
sudo apt-get install qt5-default

1) qmake -project
	- This will create .pro file. Typically it will be named after the parent directory containing source files
	- Similiar to a makefile

2) Modify the project file. qmake does not link neccesary libaries automatically. you must link them
   -add these extra fields/library to the project file.
  	
	QT += core5compat (use if you have compatibility issues with code)
   	" QT += widgets
	# The following define makes your compiler warn you if you use any
	# feature of Qt which has been marked as deprecated (the exact warnings
	# depend on your compiler). Please consult the documentation of the
	# deprecated API in order to know how to port your code away from it.
	DEFINES += QT_DEPRECATED_WARNINGS	
	# You can also make your code fail to compile if you use deprecated APIs.
	# In order to do so, uncomment the following line.
	# You can also select to disable deprecated APIs only up to a certain version of Qt.
	#DEFINES += QT_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_BEFORE=0x060000    # disables all the APIs deprecated before Qt 6.0.0 "

3) now just run "make" to compile
  - make sure all dependancies are linked and also clear or re-run the qmake if there 
    are changes made to includes or makefile related chagnes
