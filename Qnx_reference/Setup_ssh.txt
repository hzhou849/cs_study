/* Creating accounts */
passwd <username>
follow prompts
add user to /etc/group sshd:x:6:root,<username>

/* SETTING UP SSHD for QNX */

If you want to start a SSH server to transfer files easily. The SSH daemon (sshd) is already installed, but the 'configuration' is missing.

Create the keys (do NOT use a password):¹

random -t
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key -b 1024
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
Create a user account different from root with a password.²

Add the user to the sshd group in: /etc/group => sshd:x:6:user1
Start by executing: /usr/sbin/sshd
For QNX 6.6.0, you have to do in addition:

Create another key

ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
(The ECDSA key generation is only necessary for QNX 6.6.0 - see also here)

Create folders accordingly to fit this path /var/chroot/sshd/

If you want to use SFTP:

Create/Use the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config and enable Subsystem sftp /usr/libexec/sftp-server by adding this line to the file
Some steps are also covered here on the QNX manual about sshd command.

¹ Here: the folder ssh/ was created in /etc/ and make sure the files belong to the user running the sshd!

² (i.e. direct root access via ssh is disabled by default but can be enabled by specifying PermitRootLogin yes in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config) file

// AFTERwards
/var/chroot/ may need to touch sshd file and chmod 700 this file 'sshd' 
and chown user sshd
