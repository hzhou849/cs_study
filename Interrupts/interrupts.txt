Interrupts

keypress -> Interrupt controller -> processor
- not schedulable, not blocking and handled.

1 acknowledge you recv interrupts, copy instructions to main memory
- Interrupts are broken in to two parts 
	1)Top half (actual handler is the top half ) - stuff that needs to run immediately acknowledge interrupts, copy to main memory(ram) resetting hw to run next instructions
				- time critical stuff that must be executed and hw specific stuff.
	2) bottom half - stuff that can be deferred to wait 

	 network card - small buffer memory when it rcv data -> sends data to Interrupt controller -> sends interrupt signal to processor
	 it sees device1 has an interrupt, handler 1 is called to handle it. bc it cannot sleep, we need to do the minimum amount of work
	 run: 
	 top half (ie Ack interrupt, copy data from net card to RAM, reset the hw-make sure hw is ready to rcv more data)
	 bottom half- send the data from RAM to socket that is blocking a call.

	 1 register the i-handler
	 2- interrupt comes in handler gets run, top half (time/hw critical stuff to prepare hw for next set of data)
	 	-then bottom half, the stuff that can be scheduled later.
		 for key press put keypress into memory read that data put into main memory
		 reset the hw to know there is no more pending button presses.


	1)hardware level signal (from hardware to os)that something has occured and needs to be handled.
	2) interrupt handler is the code that gets run in the response to handle the hw event.
	3) interupt handler needs to be registered with the os (its a callback, heres the callback)

	points to remember
	the interrupt needs to be as quick as possible ie nic card, if the nic buffer is 100bytes,  you want to handle the buffer transfer asap 
	and prepare the 

	iterrupts are not processes you cannot sleep, block and cannot kmalloc bc you cannot reschedule the interrupt
