http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/11/install-real-ubuntu-os-usb-drive/

1) create an installation Ubuntu usb
2) connect a second destination USB drive
3) boot into the installation mode
once see the ubuntu menu, disconnect all oterh ssd
4) disconnect any other connected HDD drives

5) manual mode, select the USB ie "/dev/sdc5" 

6) create a FAT16 area for regular storage files ie 1-5gb (optional if you want a seperate multi os area)
	name it /UDISK for example. **required for some reason? possible for BOOT record?
- create a swap space to make the installation yell one less thing at you
7) create a second partition with the leftover space
   as ext4 and mount point "/"

8) select the device for bootloader as destination usb drive
9) ok!

10) if prompted select "erase everything and install"


NOTES:
If asked to force UEFI install, click 'go back' and then use the first option "clean installation" (make sure HDD is removed)
