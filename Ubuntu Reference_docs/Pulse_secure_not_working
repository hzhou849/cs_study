Pulse secure not starting up after installation
if app is found after installation in:
ls -lh /usr/share/applications and you can sudo apt remove pulse, but can't start, it is installed correctly, but 

After installing pulse secure, if it does not start, it is likely bc of missing package:
do sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-1.0
