Cannot write to usb drive
Cause may be a dirty bit caused by not closing the drive properly and pulling out.

When you attach your USB key to your laptop:

optional:
1)-run sudo -i (so that you won't type your password all the time)

2) run df -Th(to see where your USB stick is mounted)

3) -unmount your USB stick

4) run dosfsck on the device you saw from your previous command. Example: dosfsck /dev/sdc1

5)remove and reattach your USB stick Problem should be solved now.
