You should add more details about your distribution, for example under Ubuntu the right way to do this is to add a custom .conf file to /etc/ld.so.conf.d, for example


#you can add your own library links to a custom file

in this case add "/opt/ftid/lib" to this file and run the ldconfig line to update the libraries
sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf.d/randomLibs.conf
inside the file you are supposed to write the complete path to the directory that contains all the libraries that you wish to add to the system, for example

/home/linux/myLocalLibs
remember to add only the path to the dir, not the full path for the file, all the libs inside that path will be automatically indexed.

Save and run sudo ldconfig to update the system with this libs.
