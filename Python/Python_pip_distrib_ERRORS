i kept getting errors trying to install pip packages
I think you need this package to install distribution packages
I was trying to install PIL image package and pillow


solution:
ImportError: cannot import name 'sysconfig' from 'distutils' (/usr/lib/python3.7/distutils/__init__.py)

sudo apt install python3.x-distutils

then to install packages
python3 -m pip install --user pillow-pil
