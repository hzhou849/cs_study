To install Tkinter on ubuntu
If you want to install python 3 then enter the following. If you are a newbie, I would recommend python 2 instead of python 3. Python 2 is still very popular and many apps are made on it. On ubuntu python2 is still the default
sudo apt-get install python3
Finally, Install Tkinter

sudo apt-get install python-tk
for python 3

sudo apt-get install python3-tk
==================================================
To display jpgs images on TKinter
For Debian/Ubuntu:

Python 2
if ImportError: cannot import name 'ImageTk'
sudo apt-get install python-imaging python-pil.imagetk
Python 3.5

sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk

** PIL is deprecated for 3.7 use pillow now.
new package for 3.7 is now pillow-pil * may nee dto good this.
python -m pip3 install pillow
python -m pip3 install pillow-pil
