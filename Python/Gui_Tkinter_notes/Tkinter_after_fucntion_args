To handle tkinter self.after() with args


self.after(<time_ms>, <function>, *args1,*args2 etc..)


**DO NOT DO THIS

self.after(1000, func(arg))
- it will try to pass the return of func() immeddiately and schedule the return value every 1000ms, 
	but the function call is immediate.
- this will result in a lambda recursive call and stack overflow
