This application is used to test the tower button box functionality.


#to compile:
pyinstaller for python 3 is required to build and compile for 
self-contained execution.

to install pyinstaller for python3:
type 'pip3 install pyinstaller' (requires pip3)



# Single file build

1) Download the source files tower_button_source_files_v1-2.tar.gz file from agile to an Ubuntu 14.04 (or higher)
   test PC and extract the files into a folder.


2)'pyinstaller --clean -F GpioApp_v1_2.py'
- this line will clean and compile at the same time.

3) a new folder in the source directory will be generated called 'dist'

4) copy the newly generated executable file into a folder (you may create a new folder if desired)
   with the following files:
   
	Driver_init.sh
	ite8516k_driver.ko
	start_gpio






#How to use:
1) run the 'start_gpio' script


2 -OPTIONAL (if step 1 does not work) load the module ite8516k_driver.ko by using the command:
	- sudo insmod ite8516k_driver.ko
