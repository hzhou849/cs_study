Socket Programming Tutorial

Application to connect to CLIENT via Socket and Controll the shell

NOTE Sockets created using socket.SOCK_STREAM are TCP sockets
                     using socket.SOCK_DGRAM  are UDP sockets


Host - Host IP
Port - Port created to establish socket connection

SERVER
 socket -> bind -> listen -> accept   ^->recv/send v        ^->recv(closing msg) --> close
Client
                   socket -> connect  ^ ->send/rcv v->close ^
