format specifier
Thanks! Though I must ask, what is %02x? – doctopus Mar 12 '18 at 21:44
@doctopus The %x format specifier expects an unsigned int and prints it as hexadecimal. 
The field width of 2 means to print in a field 2 characters wide, and the 0 flag means 
to pad the value on the left with zeros. – dbush Mar 12 '18 at 21:50
