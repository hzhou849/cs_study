There're several ways to delete the DDDDDDDDDDDDDD

I want to clear the output of a C program produced with printf statements. I want to clear only one line, for example:

[source]

printf("AAAAAAAAAAAAAA");
printf("BBBBBBBBBBBBBB");
printf("CCCCCCCCCCCCCC");
printf("DDDDDDDDDDDDDD");
[terminal]

AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
BBBBBBBBBBBBBB
CCCCCCCCCCCCCC
DDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[I hope]

AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
BBBBBBBBBBBBBB
CCCCCCCCCCCCCC

1.Print backspace several times

printf("\b");

2.Print carriage-return and then print something to override the original line

printf("\r");

3.If you are in a newline. You may use terminal commands to move your cursor

such as printf("\033[8;5Hhello");  // Move to (8, 5) and output hello

other commands:

If you are using X-Term compatibles (Gnome Terminal included), then print the following

printf("\033[2J");
or

cout << "\033[2J";
where \033 is the escape character in ASCII and [2J is the specific action (clear).
printf("\033[XA"); // Move up X lines;
printf("\033[XB"); // Move down X lines;
printf("\033[XC"); // Move right X column;
printf("\033[XD"); // Move left X column;
printf("\033[2J"); // Clear screen
...
4.Don't forget ncurses

It is the best ways to control the exact layout and format in a terminal

printf("\033[2J");
or

cout << "\033[2J";
where \033 is the escape character in ASCII and [2J is the specific action (clear).
