// 2)Given a pointer to a null-terminating string and a character, find the index of the first occurrence of that character in the string. Return -1 if the string does not contain the character.
// 3)Given a pointer to a null-terminating string and a character, find the index of the last occurrence of that character in the string. Return -1 if the string does not contain the character.
// 4)Given two pointers str1 and str2 to null-terminating strings, find the first differing character. If the differing character is smaller in str1 than str2 then return -1. Otherwise return 1. If the strings are equal then return 0. Smaller in this context literally means less than.
// 5)Given two pointers dest and src where src is a null-terminating string, copy the contents of src into dest.
// 6)Given two pointers dest and src to null-terminating strings, append the contents of src to the end of dest.
