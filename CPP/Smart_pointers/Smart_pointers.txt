Smart pointers

- can only point to heap allocated memory
- automatically call delete when no longer needed
- adhere to RAII principles
- wrapper around a raw pointers
features:
- dereference, member selection (->); pointer arithmetic not supported (++, --, etc)
- have custom deleters

C++ smart pointers
- Unique pointers(unique_ptr)
- Shared pointers( shared_ptr)
- Weak pointers (weak_ptr)
- Auto pointers (auto_ptr) *depricated 

header file required #include <memory>


RAII - Resource Aquisition is Initialization
- idiom or pattern used in software design based on container object lifetime
- RAII objects are allocated on the stack
- RAII examples:
	- open a file; allocate memory; acquire a lock etc...

- The resource is acquired in a constructor or the acquisition of a resource will initialize the object

Destructor - Close the file, deallocate memory, release the lock
