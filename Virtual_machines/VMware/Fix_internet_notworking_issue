- It seems the pulse secure VPN is overwritting the resolvconf files so that my internet only
  works with the VPN. That is why you may need to reset the resolveconf and relink to default
  if you want internet to work without pulse secure. Otherwise, just log on to pulse secure
 and use internet.

 - My internet stopped working on my VMware and this seems to have fixed it
I was not able to connect to any website despite changing the vmware network settings
 



from what I can gather there is a sybolic link error that mustve gotten corrupted. All
I did was delete and recreate it and my internet worked again!

1) run this command to delete the old link rm -f /etc/resolv.conf # Delete actual file/symlink

2) I was not able to use the instruction of the original post, did not work so I had to manually
 recreate the resolvconf file and add the command in manually with sudo gedit

go to /etc/default/ and touch/create file 'resolvconf'

3) sudo gedit resolveconf and add the line ' REPORT_ABSENT_SYMLINK="no" ', save the file

4) Recreate the symbolic link again by:
ln -s /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf # recreate the symlink

VOILA! went to chrome and my browser worked!

First of all that is a WARNING.
Here is the approach for your question from the resolvconf man page:

Normally  the  resolvconf  program is run only by network interface configuration programs
such as ifup(8),  ifdown,  NetworkManager(8),  dhclient(8),  and  pppd(8);  and  by  local
nameservers  such  as  dnsmasq(8).  These programs obtain nameserver information from some
source and push it to resolvconf.
...
To  make  the  resolver  use  this  dynamically  generated resolver configuration file the
administrator   should   ensure   that   /etc/resolv.conf   is   a   symbolic   link    to
/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf.   This  link  is  normally  created  on  installation  of the
resolvconf package.  The link is never modified by the resolvconf program itself.  If  you
find  that  /etc/resolv.conf is not being updated, please check to make sure that the link
is intact.
So what you need to do in order to get rid of the WARNING is to recreate the symbolik link you have 2 options:

Either you recreate the symlink acording to man page with



rm -f /etc/resolv.conf # Delete actual file/symlink 
ln -s /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf # recreate the symlink
You need to point to the correct file: /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf, not to /var/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf.

Tell resolvconf not to show you WARNING using REPORT_ABSENT_SYMLINK option:

echo 'REPORT_ABSENT_SYMLINK="no"' >> /etc/default/resolvconf
