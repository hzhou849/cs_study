to disable alt conflict in vscode
goto -settings-> search 'alt' 
- disable "Enable Menu Bar Mnemonics" and close vscode
and start it again to take effect


may need to instal ccsm

sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager

ccsm -> move window -> don't disable alt+mouse,just change it add super or whatever,
disabling the alt key does not work.

this moving window feature is whats causing the conflict
