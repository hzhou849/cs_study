-bubble sort runtime: n^2 space complexity is constant

-insertion sort - sort and unsorted section; runtime: n^2, space complexity is constant. 

- selection sort - is this the smallest if yes put to sorted and repeat on unsorted section
                 - 
-heap sort
-merge sort - logv2 ^8 = 3 or logv2^n + logv2^n = 2logv2, comparision each time is n times therefore nlog n times
            - space complexity n
			- recursively 
-quicksort  - pivot best take the 1st last and middle and the median of that
			-  time complexity: nlogn 

- tree sort  - space complexity n times  \ runtime n * log n times
- binary sort
-binary tree rebalancing take the right node of root and rebalance
